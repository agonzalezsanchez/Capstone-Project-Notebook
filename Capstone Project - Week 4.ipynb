It will aid people who are looking for better neighborhoods to live in, such as discovering schools, supermarkets, hospitals, parks, recreational spaces, shopping malls, theatres, cafes, and other places of interest. The project will help decide which neighborhood in South Florida is the optimal choice to move to.\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "The state of Florida has seen an increase of migration due to lower taxes, great weather, job opportunities, etc.  This project aims to create a comparative analysis of features between neighborhoods.
